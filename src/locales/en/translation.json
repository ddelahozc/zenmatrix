  "video2Line4": "The second quadrant, 'Not Urgent and Important' (PLAN), is the garden where true wisdom grows. Here, long-term vision and prevention await you. Dedicate time to serene planning, for from here growth emanates.",
  "video2Line5": "The third quadrant, 'Urgent and Not Important' (DELEGATE), is the wind of distractions. These are the interruptions that demand your immediate attention, but do not contribute to your essence. Learn to delegate, to free your energy.",
  "video2Line6": "The fourth quadrant, 'Not Urgent and Not Important' (ELIMINATE), is the void. These are the tasks that drain your time and spirit without benefit. Let go, like the leaf falling from the tree.",
  "video2Line7": "By mastering this matrix, your life becomes a harmonious dance, where priority is your guide and serenity, your reward. May peace be your companion on this journey of discernment."
